All of us want to make money. The more the better. In stock market, billions are deployed every day by millions of people.

<p>Theoretically, you can earn billions on any given day. All you have to do is to take the right trades, always at precisely the right time and each time with the maximum amount of leverage that you can get.</p>

But of course, trading with leverage and trying to time the market is very risky. It's like playing Russian Roulette. It's not something you can continue doing if you want to survive for long.

In order to trade for living, we need to approach this in a professional manner. We need to be aware about everything that can go wrong so that we can design our trading strategies accounting for them.

Basically trading involves:
<ul>
<li>Observing and identifying the patterns which keep on occuring in the market from time to time.</li>

<li>Creating strategies based on such patterns having appropriate risk/reward.</li>

<li>Executing those strategies in an error free way.</li>
</ul>

Let me elaborate on each of the above 3.
<ol>
<li><strong>Studying the patterns</strong></li>
Lots of patterns have been studied and many more are still unexplored. There are so many observable variables related to any instrument, that the number of patterns are practically infinite. 

When we study any pattern, we need to study the below 3 things which are important from trading perspective. These are:
<ul>
<li>Frequency of occurence.</li>

<li>Average/Max time taken by the instrument to gain/lose x% (1%/2%/3% etc.).</li>

<li>Average/max time drawdown for x% of instrument movement.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Creating strategies</strong></li>
Once you have the relevant facts about the pattern, you can create trading strategies around it.

Creating strategies basically involves:  
<ul>
<li>trade plan i.e. when to take trade</li>
<li>capital allocation</li>
<li>risk management(having stop-loss/hedging)</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Execution</strong></li>
This basically involves executing the plan in an error free manner. This might look like an insignificant aspect on paper but in real world it's not. 
Lots of things are covered in this e.g. slippage due to liquidity issues, manual errors, errors due to external factors etc.
This aspect if ignored can prove costly. Also this aspect is something which is not always in our control. 

</ol>
