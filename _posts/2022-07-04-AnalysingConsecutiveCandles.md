In this post, I will be presenting my findings about the occurence of consecutive streaks of green/red candles in Nifty's historical data on multiple timeframes(hourly/daily/weekly/monthly).

Green candle: close >= open
Red candle: close < open

Basic aim is to see how many consecutive candles of 1 type have occured historically.
